A family-owned, world-class portfolio of brands that includes household names such as Enterprise Rent-A-Car. With a $35 billion turnover and nearly 90,000 team members across 95 countries, we’ve grown from a pioneering idea over 65-years ago, to the global mobility leader we are today. Join us, and as the TargetJobs Graduate Employer of the Year and a Times Top 100 Graduate Employer, we will offer you the freedom to explore your potential. And to progress forward on your own career path. Ready to make your move? After an initial virtual classroom-based orientation session, you’ll be assigned to a branch office for hands-on business training. Here you will learn valuable business skills from capable mentors who were once in your shoes. That’s because nearly all of our full-time employees started as a graduate in our Management Training Programme, including our current CEO. This allows everyone to learn our business from the ground up and to understand how they play a significant role in seeing it succeed. Our promote-from-within culture ensures that you’ll have a well-rounded training experience and learn skills in management, finance, operations, sales and customer service. As you progress, increasingly more opportunities will become available to you. You can choose, as most people do, to continue your rewarding ascent within our Rental Operations managerial track. Then - in as little as two years from joining as a graduate - you could become a Branch Manager in our retail network, in charge of your own team and your own profits. Or you can explore one of many other exciting options within Enterprise including Human Resources, Accounting, Revenue Management, Sales, Marketing and more. What is certain is that we encourage all of our employees to be the best they can be, and diversity is a priority in all areas of our business. We are recognised as a leader in diversity, equity and inclusion, having been included in prestigious lists such as The Times Top 50 Employers for Gender Equality and Stonewall's Top 100 Employers for LGBTQ Inclusion. Additionally, we proudly hold the title of Disability Confident Leader and rank within the top 25 of the Social Mobility Employer Index. Enterprise Mobility is also still family-owned – our CEO Chrissy Taylor is the third generation of the Taylor family to run the company. This allows us to look forward even more confidently to the future, providing the stability we need to pursue the long-term good for our business, our employees and our customers, even in these challenging times. Responsibilities As a Graduate Management Trainee, you are empowered to make business decisions that greatly affect your career as well as the bottom line. You’ll gain responsibility for developing new business and maintaining current relationships. You’ll be responsible for understanding cost control, reading your branch’s P\u0026amp;L statement and understanding what it takes to run a profitable business. You will also learn how to deliver exceptional customer service. We will teach you how to effectively communicate, influence, and interact with all types of customers, vendors, and colleagues. You’ll learn proper sales techniques, problem solving strategies and conflict management. Those skills will provide you with the opportunity to market to local business partners and build solid, long lasting relationships with key business decision makers. In your development to become a successful manager at Enterprise, you’ll learn how to mentor, train, develop, manage and promote staff of your own. In turn, we’ll reward your development with pay increases and opportunities for continued promotions. Qualifications A Bachelor’s degree is preferred; however, professional experience can be substituted if applicable. You must have a full manual UK or EU driving\u0026nbsp;licence, but we do make accommodations for applicants who don’t drive due to a disability.
